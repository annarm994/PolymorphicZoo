# Polymorphic Zoo
This Java program demonstrates polymorphism using a zoo scenario. Each animal has its unique sound, and the program uses an abstract base class and method overriding to implement this functionality.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the `ZooDemo` class to see the output.

## Features
- Polymorphism using abstract classes.
- Overloaded methods for repetitive sounds.
- Test cases for both normal and edge scenarios.
